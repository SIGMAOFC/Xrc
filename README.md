* Welcome to Nebula!
Nebula is one of the best themes built with Blueprint, providing you with both a smooth installation experience and insanely good compatibility with other extensions.


* Extension installation.
Before you can start using Nebula, you'll need Blueprint. Blueprint allows themes like Nebula to have great compatibility with other modifications made by extensions. You can find more information, download links and documentation at **https://blueprint.zip**.

After you've installed Blueprint, drag and drop the `nebula.blueprint` file over to your Pterodactyl folder (commonly /var/www/pterodactyl) and run `blueprint -install nebula`.

You can find Nebula's configuration options in your admin panel (admin > extensions > nebula). If you like the theme please leave a review on the marketplace where you've bought Nebula.


* Configuration
To make Nebula fully yours, you'll want to explore **Nebula Designer**, which stores all configuration options for Nebula and gives you an easy interface to configure everything in.


* Need help?
You can find my contact information on **prpl.wtf** or (in some cases) you can use the marketplace you've bought Nebula to send me a message.
